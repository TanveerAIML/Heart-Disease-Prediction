# <p align="center">Heart-Disease-Prediction</p>

<b>Problem Definition: - </b>This project is specifically targeting the people of all age group who are suffering from Heart problem. This project will be given a set of patient characteristics such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical history, the goal is to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing heart disease. This prediction is based on a variety of factors, including patient’s lifestyle, habits, diet, exercise and other medical conditions that may increase their risk of heart disease.

<b>Aims and Objectives: - </b>The aim of a heart disease prediction project would be to develop four different model  that can accurately predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on their characteristics and medical history. This prediction can be used to identify those patients who are at high risk of developing heart disease and can be prevent by reducing the risks.
The ultimate goal of this project is to analyse the difference between the algorithms that can predict more accurate results with which this can improve the prevention and management of heart disease, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
1.	Tools and technologies that will be used to build this project is R programming.
2.	Machine Learning Model that will be used in this project are: -	<b>Linear Regression, Neural Network, Support Vector, Naïve Bayes</b>

<b>Background Sources: - </b>Heart disease is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide, and it can affect people of all ages. Heart disease is also known as cardiovascular disease. It is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. Risk factors for heart disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle.<br>
There are several signs and symptoms that can cause a heart attack like:
1.	Chest pain which is the most common symptom of a heart attack, and it may feel like a squeezing, pressure, or pain in the center of the chest.
2.	Some people may experience discomfort or pain in the arms, neck, jaw, or back during a heart attack.
3.	Difficulty in breathing, or the feeling of being short of breath, can be a sign of a heart attack.
4.	Some people start sweating on their entire body during a heart attack.
5.	During the heart attack people start feeling dizzy or lightheaded.
