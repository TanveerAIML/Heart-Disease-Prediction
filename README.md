# <p align="center">Heart-Disease-Prediction</p>

<b>Problem Definition: - </b>This project is specifically targeting the people of all age group who are suffering from Heart problem. This project will be given a set of patient characteristics such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other relevant medical history, the goal is to predict whether a patient is at risk of developing heart disease. This prediction is based on a variety of factors, including patientâ€™s lifestyle, habits, diet, exercise and other medical conditions that may increase their risk of heart disease.

<b>Aims and Objectives: - </b>The aim of a heart disease prediction project would be to develop four different model  that can accurately predict the risk of heart disease in patients based on their characteristics and medical history. This prediction can be used to identify those patients who are at high risk of developing heart disease and can be prevent by reducing the risks.
The ultimate goal of this project is to analyse the difference between the algorithms that can predict more accurate results with which this can improve the prevention and management of heart disease, which is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide.
1.	Tools and technologies that will be used to build this project is R programming.
